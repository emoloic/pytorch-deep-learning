## 03. PyTorch  Computer Vision

### What is computer vision ?

[Computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision) is the art of teaching a computer to see.

For example, it could involve building a model to classify whether a photo is of a cat or a dog ([binary classification](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#binary-classification)).

Or whether a photo is of a cat, dog or chicken ([multi-class classification](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#multi-class-classification)).

Or identifying where a car appears in a video frame ([object detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_detection)).

Or figuring out where different objects in an image can be separated ([panoptic segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00868)).

In this module, We're going to apply the PyTorch Workflow we've been learning in the past couple of sections to computer vision.

Specifically, we're going to cover:

| **Topic** | **Content** |
| --------- | ----------- |
| **0. Computer vision libraries in PyTorch** | PyTorch has a bunch of built-in helpful computer vision libraries, let's check them out. |
| **1. Load data** | To practice computer vision, we'll start with some images of different pieces of clothing from [FashionMNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist). |
| **2. Prepare data** | We've got some images, let's load them in with a [PyTorch DataLoader](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html) so we can use them with our training loop. |
| **3. Model 0: Building a baseline model** | Here we'll create a multi-class classification model to learn patterns in the data, we'll also choose a **loss function, optimizer** and build a **training loop.** |
| **4. Making predictions and evaluting model 0** | Let's make some predictions with our baseline model and evaluate them. |
| **5. Setup device agnostic code for future models** | It's best practice to write device-agnostic code, so let's set it up. |
| **6. Model 1: Adding non-linearity** | Experimenting is a large part of machine learning, let's try and improve upon our baseline model by adding non-linear layers. |
| **7. Model 2: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** | Time to get computer vision specific and introduce the powerful convolutional neural network architecture. |
| **8. Comparing our models** | We've built three different models, let's compare them. |
| **9. Evaluating our best model** | Let's make some predictons on random images and evaluate our best model. |
| **10. Making a confusion matrix** | A confusion matrix is a great way to evaluate a classification model, let's see how we can make one. |
| **11. Saving and loading the best performing model** | Since we might want to use our model for later, let's save it and make sure it loads back in correctly. |
