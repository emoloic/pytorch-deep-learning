# Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning

This repository contains all the materials used during my PyTorch learning journey at [Zero to Mastery Academy](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/learn-pytorch/).

## What is Pythorch?

**PyTorch** is an open source machine learning framework that accelerates the path from research prototyping to production deployment.

## Why PyTorch

- Most popular research deep learning framework.
- Write fast deep learning code in Python (able to run on a GPU/many GPUs)
- Able to access many pre-built deep learning models (Torch Hub/torchvision.models)
- Whole stack: preprocess data, model data, deploy model in your application/cloud
- Originally designed and used in-house by Facebook/Meta (now opensource and used by companies such as Tesla, Microsoft, OpenAI)

## Table of Contents

| **Section** | **What does it cover?** | **Exercises & Extra-curriculum** | **Slides** |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| [00 - PyTorch Fundamentals](./00_pytorch_fundamentals/) | Many fundamental PyTorch operations used for deep learning and neural networks. |
| [01 - PyTorch Workflow](./01_pytorch_workflow/) | Provides an outline for approaching deep learning problems and building neural networks with PyTorch. |
| [02 - PyTorch Neural Network Classification](./02_pytorch_classification/) | Uses the PyTorch workflow from 01 to go through a neural network classification problem. |
| [03 - PyTorch Computer Vision](./03_pytorch_computer_vision/) | Let's see how PyTorch can be used for computer vision problems using the same workflow from 01 & 02. |
| [04 - PyTorch Custom Datasets](./04_pytorch_custom_datasets/) | How do you load a custom dataset into PyTorch? Also we'll be laying the foundations in this notebook for our modular code (covered in 05). |
| [05 - PyTorch Going Modular](./05_pytorch_going_modular/) | PyTorch is designed to be modular, let's turn what we've created into a series of Python scripts (this is how you'll often find PyTorch code in the wild). |
| [06 - PyTorch Transfer Learning](./06_pytorch_transfer_learning/) | Let's take a well performing pre-trained model and adjust it to one of our own problems. |
| [07 - Milestone Project 1: PyTorch Experiment Tracking](./07_pytorch_experiment_tracking/) | We've built a bunch of models... wouldn't it be good to track how they're all going? |
| [08 - Milestone Project 2: PyTorch Paper Replicating](./08_pytorch_paper_replicating/) | PyTorch is the most popular deep learning framework for machine learning research, let's see why by replicating a machine learning paper. |
| [09 - Milestone Project 3: Model Deployment](./09_pytorch_model_deployment/) | So we've built a working PyTorch model... how do we get it in the hands of others? Hint: deploy it to the internet. |

## Extra Resources

This course covers a large amount of PyTorch and deep learning but the field of machine learning is vast, inside here you'll find recommended books and resources for: PyTorch and deep learning, ML engineering, NLP (natural language processing), time series data, where to find datasets and more.
